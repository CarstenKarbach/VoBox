VoBox

An Android app for learning vocabularies. You can add your own list of vocabularies to learn.
Each word mapping is saved in a card. The cards are organized in card boxes. You can test
yourself. If your answered are right, the cards are placed in upper boxes, otherwise they
are moved downward.

# VoBox

create and learn your own vocabulary with card boxes

An Android app for learning vocabulary. You can add your own list of dictionaries to learn.
Each word mapping is saved in a card. The cards are organized in card boxes. You can test
yourself. If your answers are right, the cards are placed in upper boxes, otherwise they
are moved downward.

Create your own dictionaries and improve your vocabulary with integrated training and tests. 
You are learning a new language, reading a book with unknown words, preparing for an exam in 
school or you are on holiday abroad? VoBox organizes new vocabulary and places them in card boxes. 
Test yourself, for every correct answer the card is placed in a higher card box. Check your 
progress simply by the number of cards in each box. Create as many dictionaries as you like 
and configure their languages as well as the number of card boxes. With VoBox you can

- add own word pairs
- search in word list 
- share dictionaries via file export and import
- import dictionaries from CSV file
- create dictionaries with arbitrary language mapping
- train vocabulary without effect on word levels
- test vocabulary, right answers lead to level up, wrong answers to level down
